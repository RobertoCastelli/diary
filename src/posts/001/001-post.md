## 001 - Diary of an impostor

<img src="../../images/control.jpg" width="50" height="50">

Hi, I'm Roberto and I have a true passion for programming languages and computers. 

I recently asked myself: why not bring into fruition my avid interest in the programming field to enhance my career?

So I began putting every possible effort to achieve this goal (and still continuing to do so) once I decided to pursue this path.

Special thanks to <span style="color:cadetblue">[Jaga Santagostino](https://jagasantagostino.com/)</span>, my mentor.

Stay tuned!
