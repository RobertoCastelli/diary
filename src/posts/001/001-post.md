## 001 - Diary of an impostor

![dune](../001/dune.jpg)

Hi I'm an impostor, my name is Roberto and I'm a 40 y.o. Project Manager. Since I was a youngster I had a passion for programming languages.

I recently asked myself: why not bring into fruition my avid interest in this field to enhance my career?

I began putting every possible effort to achieve this goal (and still continuing to do so) once I decided to pursue this path.

This blog is a story in continuous evolution to keep track of my progress, paths, errors, achievements in the hopes of helping other people to share this adventure.

Special thanks to [Jaga Santagostino](https://jagasantagostino.com/), my mentor.

Stay tuned!
