## 001 - Diary of an impostor

![dune](../../images/impostor.png)

Let's start from here.

I recently asked myself: why not bring into fruition my avid interest in the programming field to enhance my career?

So I began putting every possible effort to achieve this goal (and still continuing to do so) once I decided to pursue this path.

Special thanks to [Jaga Santagostino](https://jagasantagostino.com/), my mentor.

Stay tuned!
